# Symbols in the grammar are case-sensitive.
#
# This grammar uses a convention that
#    - terminals are lowercase          (president)
#    - preterminals are capitalized     (Noun)
#    - other nonterminals are all-caps  (NP)
#
# This convention just makes grammars more readable to humans.  Thus:
#
#    - When *you* are writing grammars, you should
#      follow this convention unless you have a good reason not to.
#
#    - But the  *program* should still work with grammars that don't
#      follow this convention.  So how can the program reliably tell
#      the difference between terminal and nonterminal symbols?  If
#      there is at least one rule for rewriting a symbol, then that
#      symbol is a nonterminal and should be rewritten.

# The basic grammar rules.  Here's what the abbreviations stand for:
#    S  = sentence
#    NP = noun phrase
#    VP = verb phrase
#    PP = prepositional phrase
#    Det = determiner (sometimes called "article")
#    Prep = preposition
#    Adj = adjective
#    Verb = verb
#    Comp = complementizer
#    Coord = coordinator (e.g end,or)
#    Vi   = intransitive verb
#    V5   = verbs before complementizer
#    V6 = verbs before NP and complementizer
#    Ving = verbs that ends with ing
#    Nnp = Proper noun
#    Be = the verb 'to be' in his forms
#    Adv = adverb
#    VP_COMP = verb phrase with complementizer
#    Pronoun = Pronoun
#    SBAR = phrase/sentence that starts with complementizer
#    Obj = it as a Noun
#    VerbPP = verb with prepositional after it

# Vocabulary.  Your program can see that "ate" is a terminal
# symbol because there exists no rule for rewriting it.
# Any symbol that can rewrite as a terminal (or a string of
# terminals, like "chief of staff") is called a "preterminal."  Notice
# that a preterminal is a special kind of nonterminal.
